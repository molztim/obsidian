## Physics Case

- SHiP: Search for Hidde particles in Hidden sector
- This includes HNLs (heavy Neutral Leptons = Extreml weak interacting, but massive leptons or neutrino like particles, which could explain the exisitng but very small neutrino mass), ALP/WISPss (Any light particle/Weakly interacting Sub-eV particles = light BSM particles below th EW scale of 100 GeV), Dark Photons (= couples to dark matter like photon to normal matter, maybe mixes with photons, hence detectable with our instruemnts), dark scalars (= a scalar field expression of dark matter, 2 D.o.F - slef interaction and mass)
- Very light hidden sector particles (~10keV) can be studied in X-ray telescopes in space
- Mass of 1GeV or above: accessible at colliders (m > 3GeV: Colliders, energy frontier, m< GeV: beam dump facilities, intensity frontier)
- HNL production: Decay of D & B mesons and bremsstrahlung
- HNL Detection: Decays into visible charged leptons, photons, etc...
- Hence we have our Setup: Production in target, filterin in muon shield and absrober, decay in decay volume, detector in the end

## Setup

- We have adedictaed general prupose Beam dump facility. 
- ECN3 (Experimental Cavern Norht 3).
- Beam is CERN SPS 400 GeV proton beam 
- Beamline intensity: 4 x 10¹³ protons/spill -> 3 x 10¹⁹ protons on target per year, for 15 years of running 6 x 10²⁵ protons on target
- Programm: Neutrino detection with Scattering and neutrino detector (SND)
- Search for light dark matter vias nuclear & eelctron recoil
- And also vtau physics (interactions and incused charm production)
- Search for FIPs with Hidden sector decay spectrometer
- Decay of instable HNLs, ALPs, for MEV to GeV search over many orders of magnitude in coupling strenght
- Beam delivery (SPS to ECN3)

## Detectors

- Target: 12 lambda Ti-Zr-Mo (TZM) + Wolfram blocks in tallium, shielded with iron and cocnret, water cooled and in vacuum
- First absorber: 5m magnetised hadron stopper
- Yields within acceptance 2x10¹⁷ D mesons, 1.4x10¹³ B mesons, 2x10¹⁵ tau-neutrinos, O(10²⁰) photons with E > 100 MeV
- Muon Shield: Two system Muon shield to split muons to left and right away from decay volume, around 5.1 T, 2x10¹⁰ µ to < 10⁵ µ per spill
- SND: PArticle Tracking with micrimeter resolution to capture interactions of vtau. Use Emulsion Coud chamber bricks (50 emulsion films and 59 tungsto layers per brick) with hintermediate Target tragger form SciFis + magnet and muon sprectometer
- SBT: 50m long decay volume in frustrum shape, sits within muon sancturay of magnet. Use helium at 1bar for decay volume. Baloon is inside lightweight Al/steel strcture to minimize µ and tau interactions. 
- Seamless integration with SBT: Tagging if µ and nezutrino induced BG with high time resolution O(1ns) and highe ffiency >99.0% for MIPs
- 850 cells, 145kl of LS (LAB+ PPO), isntrumente with 1.5k WOMs and read out by SIPMs
- Spectrometer: 4mx6m with large apperature. Tracking < 120µm, Hit effinciy >99.0%. Made from Cu/Au coated Mylar drift tubes (~NA62 design), filled with Ar/CO2 (7:3) mixture. Overall: 2x2 stations of 4 double layers at 10 dehgree stero angle + 10k channels. Two staions sit between a magnet: 0.65Tm
- Timing detector: EJ200 plastic scintilaltor bars read out with SiPMs, create timestamp and ToF for identification of deca products with magnets
- pID and Ecal/Hcal: plastic scinits and thin Fe absorbers for Ecal, 5 thick layers of Fe absorber and pastic scintis, 1-3 micromegas 


## Signal and Background

### Signal

- See slides, mostly ions, leptons, kaons, some neutirnos, and mayebe quarcks for HNLs
- The purpose of our parts: 
	- Tracker: Reconstruct decay vertex of charged particles
	- Calorimeter: Detect neutral particles and also allow for path recostruction, get invariant mass of all aprticles.
	- pID: Identify particles to distinguish what we catched

### Background

- Classical: Muon gets not defelcted enoug nad ends up in spectrometer (or gets defelcted inwall) - 1.3+-2.1 x 10⁻⁴ partially reconstructed events
- Muon DIS: Muon interacts with decay vessel, material in decay vessel or wall and creates shower particles - <0.2 p.r.e. 
- Neutrono DIS Neutrino interacts with matieral in decay volume and creates new particles. - 1.0 p.r.e
- Hence we have; muon shield, UBT & SBT, timing detector 

# Sensitivity

- Siehe plots for ALPs: (assuming 90% CL), 6x10²⁰ pot
- Calculation: sensCalc & fairship simulation

### Alps

- Production: B mesons decay, pseudoscalar mixing, Primakoff scattering (neutral mesons from photon interactiopn with elektric field of nucleus)
- Exclusive coupling to = ALP couples exclusivly to these particles

### HNL

- Production: D & B meson decay
- U²e = 
- BC6 = 

### HSDS



### Neutrinos

- Picture with neutrino for reli density
- Hope t get vtau corss section and first idrect measurement of antu vtau, and vtau magnetic moment



## Outlook

- Handed in Proposal, accpeted by cern. Green light for ECN3 facility ugrade 
- Start of TDR (technical development and researcg)& PRR (preliminary requirement review, Konzept fertigstellen und umsetzbarkeit bestätigen) phase
- First data: 2031

# Questions

- S1: X-ray? warum bis 10keV?
- S4: The picture looks odd - why vl to unknown?
- S14: Warum genau haben wir hinter dem SND ein muon spectrometer?
- S22: Was bedeuten diese sensitivity plots? Was heißt U¹? Was bedeuten die anderen symbole an der Seite? Warum Dark Scalar an Higgs? 
- S22: Dirac und Majorana Neutrinos: These are just two candidates to find/exclude?

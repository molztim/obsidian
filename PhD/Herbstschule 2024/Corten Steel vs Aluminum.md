- Original Design: Corten Steel + Paint. Cheap, simple to manifacture and paint yields high refelctivity
- But we decided to go with aluminum and helium.

### Why?

- Spray Coating of cells is a difficult process and hard to scale, especially if done at site
	- We have to polish the surface
	- Then apply anti rust primer
	- then apply paint
	- Inbetween we need dry phases, and we spray through insufficient openenigs.
- Rust problem: Water inside Paint attacks stelle walls, forms rust and destroys the paint. Even with anit-rust-rpimer
- Rust also degrades transpaerency of LS. Repurification is also unlikely due to cost
- BaSO4 coating ages faster then expected

## Solution

- Use Boxes made from aluminum with helium ballon for decay volume
- Al does not need coating, only polishing. Feature highest metal UV refelctivity. BaSO4 had ~80% reflectivity at 380nm, Al ~60% reflectivity, and ist stable.
- These boxes are also simpler to handle.s
- Drawbacks: Wall thickness to prevent buckeling, more expensive welding, integration int o system is harder.
- Using Al also changes the general structure, filling and material cost. Hence: Additional Sturdy for LS and Al boy needed (next etst beam)

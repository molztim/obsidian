## Physics Case

- What Physics are we looking for and what proerties do they have?

We are looking for undiscovered particles. Instead of the energy frontier, we look at the intensity frontier for lighter particles below 100 GeV, like HNLs, ALPs, WISPs, Dar Scalars and Dark, which all are not heavy, but feature extremly low coupling to the SM.


## Experiment Concept

- What kind of experiment are we? Why are we like this?

We decided to produce these particles at an accelerator and detect possible visible decays. To compensate the low cross section, a high luminosity is necessary. This is achieved by using a high intensity proton beam and a dense metallic target. The beam is shoot on the target where we expect proto-proton interaction between beam protons and the protons in the nuclei of the metallic target. These interations will yield our hidden sector particles. The luminosity reuslts from the high proton density of both the beam and the metal. said proton-ptoton interactions yield many differnet particles, where we expect the decay of D and B mesons as well as Bremsstrahlung to produce the majority of FIPs. the FIPs travel downstream and decay inside a decay volume. The decay volume is connected to particle detectors, to record particle momentum, type and energy. These parameters are used to reconstruct the orginial hidden sector particle for a discovery.

Limts: the length and position of our decay volume as well as the energy we gain from the beam.

## Experiment Structure 

- How will this concept materialise?

According to this concept, the experiment was designed. It is placed in the North area of CERN in the beam dump facility ECN3 (Experimental cavern Number 3). This is the beam dump of the SPS, which we will use after its current upgrade for its 400 GeV proton beam. The poit: Its density is higher than the LHC. This beam ist shot on a dense tagret made from primaly tungsten, since its the most dense non radiaioactive material. The interactions of beam protons and nuclei protons produce a shower of particles, which either decay,a re absorbed by a magnetised absorber or deflected by our muon shield. Afterwards, only a few muons, neutrinos and our hidden sector particles remain and enter the decay volume. Here, they enter a 50m long helium atmospher where they can decay into SM particles. These particles enter a combined system amde from a specrometer, PID, Ecal, Hcal and muon detector to flly recosntruct the paricles properties.

## SBT Concept and Dev

- What is an SBT? Where is my work to be located?

Since the shielding cannot deal with certain muons and neutrino, we will observe them as background in our decay volume. To further suppress these events, the decay volume is instrumented to the front with a UBT and sourrounded by the SBT. The SBT is made of ~1k individual cells, which are mounted to grid whcih also encompases the helium volume. Each of tehse cells is a compact scinitalltion detector, fileld with state of the art LS made from LAB and PPO. This active detector voulme is observed by a WOM to catch scintilaltion light and guides it towards the electronic light detection with SiPMs.

The SIPMs generates analog waveforms from the captured scintillation lights and relays them to the so called "eMUSIC". This ASIC amplifes and shapes the SIPM signals, before relaying the m further downstream to an ADC unit for digitilisation and final storage on a desktop.The development and testing towards a scalable and cheap, but powerfull and  readout for our SBT cells is the content of my PhD thesis.

# GANDALF Conclusion

- After at month of testing the GADNALF seems unift for the task of taking data with two devices and 2x8 channels.
- The GANDALF seem to struggle majorly for signals <1ms periode, and looses it for <10µs.
	- Reason 1: The GANDALFs cannot run syncrons. Both GANDALFs have shown fluctating time steps for test signals (osci) with the same periode. The step size varies randomly.
	- Reason 2: The GANDALF does not capture all events but drops certain events. The cause could not be determined yet.
	- Reason 3: It unkown if the event number corresponds to the order of events.
- Hence I decided to drop the GANDALF in favour of a 16 channel WAVECATCHER. However, this does not disqualifies the GANDALF for Johannes purposes.
- My resultion: Somebody needs to look into python code + VHDL code of the GANDALF and repeat my experimets:
- Give the GANDALF a periodic burst signal (20ns width, 10µs periode, rise time ~2ns) with an equivilant trigger. Apply pulse-width modulation (1%) to these pulses. Then check the data if the widths of the burst for the same event number *and* the same time are equal. For ease, calcualte the derivative o the signals and check for the maximum and the minm. Their difference ist your pulse width in bins. Use a trigger with the same signal periode and an external trigger.

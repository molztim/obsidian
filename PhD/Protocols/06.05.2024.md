# Done

- I finally handed in the Annahme als Doktorrant and a Studiengangwechsel to Ms Walraff to get into PhD
- Also the Prüfungsamt of theology wrote back. They claimed, since I hadn't registered for any Studienleistung or Prüfungsleistung, nothing would die if I leave
- Little Osci borke down, brought it to workshop.
- Got the medium sized down. Works fine ATM
- New theories about issues with signal:
	- Maybe the rust spread so far that the light yield is simply too low
	- Maybe the WOM is cracked or broken
	- maybe the electronics (SIPM and eMUSIC) are done and broke down again?
- Wrote a bit about GANDALF data reading. Doeskin work so good. Event #28 is corrupted.
- Introduced Johannes to his new workstation.

# ToDo

- Organize my stay in china
- Ask Horst about the point of disassembling the cell to inspect inside and parts.

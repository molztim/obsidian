# Wavecatcher Setup

- I mounted the Wavecatcher. Works like a charm.
- Setup file is saved to EPROM and locally. Use all 16ch and trigger on backplate.
- Baseline: 20ns data, window from 0 - 40ns
- Windwow for integration: 120ns because DESY has 120ns.  -30ns and +90ns around peak.
- Pulse is assumed to be between 30ns and 150ns
- No threshold.
- Wrote files: 20k_120ns_XXX
- Looks promising.
- Distriution is much tighter than position from DESY because of MIP! Electrons are lighter, can deposit more energy via shower production.

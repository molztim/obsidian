# Done

Worked on the Muon Trigger for the One Cell upgrade
- I will ditch all the ideas for spacers below the PMTs, since I can use them only onto of the Cell. There is another wood plank in the center of the euro palette, which shrinks the small space below even more.
- I Had my first introduction by Sani to The Setup and Gandalf.
- He told me that the Gandalf needs a procedure to work
	- First, boot Gandalf, send configuration via one command. On error, reboot and send again. Check clock.
	- Second create place for Gandalf to write data to (command on wiki)
	- Third, start data writing by activating readthread.py
	- Fourth, open a new terminal window and arm Gandalf by activating the signal passing to the ADC. 
	- After data taking, first disarm Gandalf
	- Then stop the active data writing process
- I also fetched Cables for the NIM modules: (Horst did not like this)
	- 2x 2ns for connecting the discriminator and the coincidence unit
	- 2x 4ns to connect outgoing signals from coincidence unit to Gandalf's
	- 2x 16ns to connect input of discriminator with PMTs
- I still lack a HV module. There is one module up here, but it is old and has a course settings.

# ToDo

- Check with E-Workshop for HV cables and HV NIM module
- In the afternoon there is the meeting with Sani for trigger.
- get the coincidence running.

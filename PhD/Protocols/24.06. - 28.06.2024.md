# Done

- Figured out the way amc_hax analyses the data from the binary file. Wrote my own script fo that, way faster.
- Took a bit of data
- Adapted wavecatcher software to GANDALF binary files iwth the help of Christian Scharf. I also played around with the fit params:
	- Open pyroot-env, navigate to gandalf_ana2, wavecatcher-analysis, execute "python examples/Freiburg/read_Freiburg_data.py 35" with teh 35 or 164 for the gandalf.
	- The parameter for the fit can be adjusted in line 86 and 88 of read_Freiburg_data.py
	- The signal is defined as: maximum amplitude and -20ns and +30ns (can be adjusted in Zeile 49,50)
- I looked at the GANDALF binaries with the bad data - the bianries are already broken. So ADC issue.
- I also adjusted the run script.
	- First, I added the option "-t" to multiread.py. If -t ist defiend by a number, the software runs these seconds long (no q possible). If not, one needs to use q to exit the data takeing
	- Im scrapped the strange script and implemented this new multiread.py with the script. It runs good so far...


# ToDo

- I'm still haunted by  the GANDALF just writing data bad. I guess it is an ADC issue.
- One GANDALF better? The timing issue remains.
- Start to interpret the data.

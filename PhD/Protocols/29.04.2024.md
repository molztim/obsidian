# Done

Continued working on the Muon Trigger for the One Cell upgrade
- Installed a delay unit. Horst told me later, that they are unreliable.
- Measured accidental coincidences
	- PMT UP: 570223
	- PMT DOWN: 864722
	- COINCIDENCE: 18685
	- ACC: COINCIDENCES: 131
- Measured for 2h 30min
- Tested setup with gandalf for external trigger.
- Window: 500ns, latency: 200ns
- Found beautiful SIPM signals on one Gandalf - an also some very small ones
- but the other Gandalf doesn't see anything. Needs investigation
- Johannes Wenk is coming as well. He will refurbish the black box and take SIPM signals from Sensl, Hamamatsu and Broadcom SIPMs. For this purpose, he will use a Gandalf up here. Its my job to help in building up the gandalf.
# ToDo

- Adjust window + latency
- Get 2nd Gandalf to run

A small, tropical Island nestled somewhere in the Saraaisto. Its famous for its twin.black peak made from old volcanic activities, which have given an withered away to time, and left a classical skyline. The shores are covered with beautiful beaches on the South and East side, while the West side ist much more rocky and the north side is covered in high cliffs. These feature a large waterfall of salt water, which comes from the core of a forge. The best approach ist from the south.  

## Inhabitans

The island is presumably inhabited. However, merfolk lives nearby in an reef and sometimes also comes ashore to bath in the sun. One can also find submerged hideouts in the secret cave behind the waterfall. 

## Vegetation

One can also harvest ananas and mango here. A few trees are on the west and east side respectively. 
Along the salt water river grow also some more resistant, harned plants, mostly with thorns and hard crusts. However, they are delicious and make an ecellent topping for soup.

The island is home to several rare insect species and a large population of scorpions. One also has a small number of Giant Bats, but only  the one that eat fruit (Flughunde).

There is much more wildlife in the water. Schools of tropical fish, also dangerous ones like lion fish and some small sharks are inhabiting the area. Molluscs and seaweed is very common here. There are also some marine mammals like seals and orcas. There are a lot of salt-water amphibians, like large salamander.

## The Salt-Water Forge

The Salt Water forge has entrances below water and above water. For above water, one has to venture in one of the caves and crush or roll a way a few boulders, which block a large stone-made elevator. This platform runs on rails along four pillars at the side (10x10m) and features dwarven carving. It currently lacks the key and a power source (lightning, fire, cold) work. Once activated an a key is used, it goes down for 2 mins around 10m into the earth. 

The ocean entrance is near the Akula and a bit hidden between a few bouders.

Here, a large hall with two side caverns open up. It features a ground floor and second level. The main hall is a forge with large pools of salt water (which are connected to the ocean), an entrance in a lowered section to the  ocean, several large furnaces from bottom to ceiling, which are cold, and a large Ram.
The floor is littered with power from rock and ores. An investigation allows to determine that the powder is made from a mixture of iron, obsidian and aluminium. One can also find some of these ores laying in corners.
One can find tools around - looks like tools for armor making. One can also find massive (5x5m) forms for scales and leather. They made scale armor here. They are surrounded by large round metal anvils. When looking around, one can find rests of several old armors.
The furnaces, 3, are made from massive stone and feature accesses on both sides to put through large pieces of metal. Several tubes connect these forges on the ground with a source. This can be found by lifitng the stone plates or following the channels. Their is a drill hole into the deep, that is sealed by several stone plates. Its warm - lava is behind this. If opened by force, a bit of lava flows out making its way slowly to the forges, which are heated up over the course of a day. Afterward, one has hot furnaces.
The Ram is a large (3x2m) weight that requires a mechanism to be run. It goes all the way to the top and throug the sealing. The power comes from a mechanism on the second platform and can be activated when removing a stone palte hold in place by 10 Bolts. Then the water rushes through an myriade of water channels and flows into the pool. Ram is raised by a turbine run by the high pressure water, but it does not goes up to the . When released, the ram comes down with an execcivly loud noise. 
A control panel on one side allows to open 5 big valves, which hold back lava. Ones open, the lava and water mix. the steam runs through another turbine, which spools up way faster and accelerates the lava flow as well as increase the power of the ram. its lifted to its maximum postion.

One side cavern features rails coming from the large salt water pools into a small, hexgonal room. Here, three old tables lay in shambles, as well as large, empty cabinets for books. The ceiling is scripted with magic runes, which produce a feint blue light upon entering. There war also once painting on the ceiling. Several metal chairs lay around and there is also a large wagon for moving stuff. The rubble beneath the tables hides several stone plates and residuals of copper and metal frameing. The plates are inscribed with description for a ritual, apparently allowing to alter the property of the metal. This is readable. There is also a molding form for a cannon inside.

Together with the ritual and the scrap parts of the old armors, once can make a mariners scale mail. 

When run on full power, one can also melt in the cannons and create a new one.

The last side cavern features beds, living quarters, a few old beer tanks and a large playing table. An old card set can be found. On the main wall of the dining hall is a large, beautiful stone carving in the wall. Its hows around 15 dwarves of similar appearance but different ages - all named - as well as 5 mervolk standing next to each other like for a picture. A slogan can be read: "Earth and Sea worked hand in fin here for 50 happy years - Year 284." 

## The wreck of the "Akula"

When approaching the island, one can see a wrecked ship in the sand. its about 3m below surface, with the ground around 8m distance below surface. The ship is a simple one mast of 20m length and a large, bulky hull. Its broken into two pieces int eh center and has a large gap on the right side. Parts are submerged in sand. Most likely cause is smashing into rocks and the drifting back out.

Upon diving, one can find colorful sheets of sea weed hanging from the mast. Most of it is rotten or covered in marine live.

The front part features 3 decks, a main deck, crew quarters and one is hidden within the sand. The name of the ship is "Akula" and written in elvish. Upon entering the lower part, one can find two old cannons. They appear to be in a bad condition, but not destroyed. There is also some cannon balls there. 

The aft part features 4 decks (one raised, the main deck, a lower deck and supply room). The lower deck is home to a few crabs that will attack the group. One can also find there the long forgotten navigations deck together. Between a few planks is the journal. By reading it on land, one can get that the ship had a highly potent explosive inside. One can retrieve it by entering the supply room. This one is accessible through a staircase in the back. The door is not locked, but jammed from the inside. One can also enter through a hole in the bottom of the ship. Inside is a large barrel of runepoweder - a power full explosive.

The cannons can be repaired by using the forge and maybe aska few mervolk.

## The old yard of a hermit

On another side of the island, on a rocky plateau with a small garden and a hut made from rocks. Its quite the climb up there, but after one passes a wall, one finds oneself in a  beatuiful garden of different kind of small plants, most of the a good version for tea.

The hermit living here is a high Elf named Hulon Ravur. A large, tall figure with short white hair und grey eyes, clothed in simple beige and blue linen clothing. In contrast, he wears a preciouse pearl necklace with sea weed and a beatiful collar from silk. He is friendly to the group, offers tea and some advice for the island. He came here after he decided to spend a few decades in isolation away from the sometimes really tight high elven societies. He meditates, thinks about his live and takes great pleasure in making tea. He also writes a book.

Inside the little cave he calls home one can find a sleeping mat, a small desk, some strange ink 8made from squid), a writing pen made from bird weather and paper made from sea weed (he trades this with the mervolk for tea), as well as Ananas and other fruits. Light comes from a single small magic light he does himself. The entrance can be covered by sheet of linnen.There is also a small megabat called Nathan, which sleeps most of the time, but will occasionally peak out, to take a look at the newcomers.

If they speak to him, he will ask the adventurers to take the treasure from the place, but not recommend this place for a trading post.

Hulon knows about the wrecked ship, and also knows, that this favorite spot for mervolk to come. If one arrives there by dawn, some mervolk (Zett, Tee and Arr) for watching sunset and the stunning crimson red sky.

## The half-submerged Efferd Temple

A beautiful but simple Efferd temple with a slumbered part and an overwater part.

The submerged part features a staircase built inside the rock with large seaweed gardens left and rigth. A few stones float on chains and spread a colourful light. The staircase leads to a submerged platform with a large statue of Efferd. 

A second staircase comes from the shore down into the water and then through similar gardens towards the round place with the statue. The staircase extends from the rock above, and is surrounded by small plants and bushes. At its top, there ist another round stone plateau which features some long stone carved chairs and stains of food (somebody consumed ananas here) as well as a low table. A statue of bolgrim, the god of forge and dwarves, sits on an altar, forging, behind everyone. The plateau is sourrounded by 5 stone steles, each carved with pictures. One shows efferd creating the sea and sky, one showing the creation of mervolk, one shows a pact between mervolk and dwarves. The next showes the landing of dwarves on enourmous ships, the last shows the creation of dwarves by bolgrim from the stone of mountains. 

When  looking closely, one can find little pressure pates on the back side. if one presses all of them (5) at the same time, the center of the platform lowers and one can find a storage room with sacrifices in it. A lot them are Ananas plated with gold. There is also coinage, an obsidian necklace (reroll a damage die 3 times per day) and a large Onyx (~600 GP)

## The small cave system

One can find a small cave system,  however large enough to get lost in. 

There can be also an encounter with Island snakes (two giant constrictor snakes). Additionally, the ground is slippery (DC) and they are inside a tunnel 10ft wide

At its end, there is wooden shak from smugglers. They have few gold pieces (200 GP), 1x Potion of lightning resistance, a clockwork amulet, 3 pinches of powder of levitation (sneeze and have levitate), gemstones (300 GP), old alcohol - mostly rum. Ther e is also a broom locked in a chest. It looks remakable good for its age (broom of flying).

## The Lair of the Lightning Salamander

There are several hints to the presence of the salamander on the island:

- Several  anmal corpses can be found. They smell like ozon.
- Large tracks can be found on the sand. They give a hint on the size and feet count of this creature.
- The creatures leaves and enters the water for hunting every 3 days.
- The hermit has seen these tracks many times.
- If one meets some mervolk, they will also tell of the beast. elusive and fast, it comes and goes as fast as a lightning, and shocks their kind. They also now that it lives on land. 

The salamandar can be ambushed or tracked down to the source of the salt water waterfall. There is a small cavern behind it whit some wood and salamander eggs, as well las some animal bones and shit.

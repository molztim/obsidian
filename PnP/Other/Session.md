# Idea

The idea is to have a small adventure for 3-5 people for 4-8h length (maybe two session.)

The characters are going to be generated on paper. I propose either Lvl 3 or Lvl 5. Everybody will get an extra Feat at Lvl 1. Lvl 4 will be Feat and ASI. We will roll the stats or do pointbuy (depending on the people) and all classes are allowed. Homebrew for the time not.

The Plot ist split in three stages:
1. The exploration of the Island
2. Fighting and puzzling at some locations
3. Killing the Lightning Salamander for the loot.

The idea is for the group to be rushed together. They all heard of a contract to scout this island. Beyond being a nice place to build a trading post or emergency station. As a bonus, all found treasure on this island becomes property of the finder. However, preparations where cut short when the storm season arrived earlier this year. Heine the group rushed to their ship - the Kirov - with minimal preparation. The goal: Explore as much as possible, scout for a location for a trading outpost and slay the beast.

Little do they know, that this Island is home to a lightning salamander. Who ist not amused by their presence.
